## 📝 Archived Documentation

The `archives/` directory contains the original planning documents in French. These represent the initial brainstorming and vision for the project:

- **PROJECT_PLAN.md** - Original vision, features, and long-term goals
- **MVP_ROADMAP.md** - Detailed 12-week sprint planning
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Comprehensive technical architecture
- **METRICS.md** - Success metrics and KPIs

These documents are kept for reference and inspiration but are not actively maintained. For current planning, use the active documentation above.
