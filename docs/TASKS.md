  ```
  Sections:
  - Weekly volume chart (bar chart - Victory Native)
  - Strength progression (line chart - selected exercises)
  - Workout frequency (calendar heatmap)
  - Personal records (list with badges)
  - Body part split (pie chart or bars)

  Charts library: Victory Native (professional charts)
  Data source: WatermelonDB aggregation queries
  ```

- [ ] 13.2 Implement context-aware volume tracking (M - 4h) `[src/lib/analytics/volume.ts]`

  ```
  Calculations (see TECHNICAL.md Analytics section):
  - Total volume: Σ (sets × reps × weight) - exclude warmup sets
  - Effective volume: Weight by exercise position and RIR
  - Volume by muscle group, movement pattern
  - Volume by week/month with nutrition phase context
  - Compound vs isolation volume (1.5x multiplier for compounds)
  - Acute Load (7-day), Chronic Load (28-day), Fatigue Ratio

  Store aggregated data in WatermelonDB for performance
  ```

- [ ] 14.1 **Implement context-aware plateau detection** (M - 5h) `[src/lib/analytics/plateau.ts]` `[CRITICAL]`

  ```
  Algorithm (see TECHNICAL.md):
  - Use Mann-Kendall trend test (simple-statistics library)
  - Linear regression for slope
  - Analyze last 4-8 weeks of data
  - CONTEXT-AWARE: Check user nutrition phase
    - If cut: stable = success (not plateau)
    - If bulk: stable = true plateau
    - If maintenance: evaluate normally
  - Return: isPlateau (boolean), trend, confidence, contextMessage

  Science-based statistical analysis, NOT AI/ML
  ```

- [ ] 14.2 Implement load management system (M - 4h) `[src/lib/analytics/loadManagement.ts]` `[NEW - CRITICAL]`

  ```
  Metrics from sports science literature:
  - Acute Load: Sum of volume (last 7 days)
  - Chronic Load: Average volume (last 28 days)
  - Fatigue Ratio: Acute / Chronic
    - >1.5 = HIGH FATIGUE → suggest deload
    - 0.8-1.5 = OPTIMAL
    - <0.8 = DETRAINING → increase volume
  - Overtraining alerts based on sustained high ratios

  Display in dashboard and post-workout reports
  ```

- [ ] 14.3 Implement personalized 1RM with RIR adjustment (M - 3h) `[src/lib/analytics/personalized1RM.ts]` `[NEW]`

  ```
  Enhancement over basic formulas:
  - Calculate base 1RM (avg of Epley, Brzycki, Lombardi)
  - Adjust by RIR: each RIR point = ~3.3% additional capacity
  - Example: 100kg × 8 @ RIR2 = higher e1RM than 105kg × 6 @ RIR0
  - Only use "working sets" (exclude warmups, RIR ≤ 3)
  - Track personal accuracy factor over time

  Compare PRs using adjusted 1RM, not just raw weight
  ```

- [ ] 14.4 Implement volume distribution analysis (M - 3h) `[src/lib/analytics/volumeDistribution.ts]`

  ```
  Analysis:
  - Volume per muscle group (pie chart)
  - Volume per movement pattern (push/pull/legs)
  - Volume per exercise category (compound vs isolation)
  - Volume per day of week (bar chart)
  - Recommendations: "Increase chest volume by 15% to match back"
  - Contextualize by nutrition phase
  ```

- [ ] 14.5 Add workout frequency & consistency analysis (M - 3h)
  ```
  Metrics:
  - Workouts per week (average, trend, by nutrition phase)
  - Most common workout days

  - Streak tracking (current, longest)
  - Calendar heatmap visualization
  - Session completion rate (started vs finished)
  ```

### 15. Performance Feedback & Reports

- [ ] 15.1 **Create post-workout report system** (L - 6h) `[src/components/analytics/WorkoutReport.tsx]` `[NEW - CRITICAL]`

  ```
  Displayed immediately after "End Workout":
  - Performance Score (1-10) based on:
    - Volume vs historical average (adjusted by nutrition phase)
    - Intensity (avg RIR, set completion)
    - Consistency (adherence to plan/template)
  - Fatigue Estimate: Acute/Chronic Load ratio
    - "Low" / "Moderate" / "High"
  - Contextualized Feedback:
    - "Volume down 8% in cut - expected and healthy"
    - "Maintained intensity despite fatigue - excellent"
  - Recommendations:
    - "Consider extra rest day this week" (high fatigue)
    - "Good recovery indicators, push hard next session"

  Keep it concise (3-4 lines max), actionable, science-based
  ```

- [ ] 15.2 **Create weekly summary system** (L - 5h) `[src/components/analytics/WeeklySummary.tsx]` `[NEW]`

  ```
  Generated every Monday morning (background task):
  - Volume trends (by muscle group, vs previous week)
  - Personal records achieved
  - Consistency metrics (workouts completed, streak)
  - Load management status (acute/chronic ratio)
  - Deload recommendation if needed (sustained high fatigue)
  - Nutrition phase context ("Week 3 of cut, strength maintained")

  Push notification: "Your Weekly Summary is ready!"
  ```

- [ ] 15.3 Add context-aware weight suggestions (M - 4h) `[src/lib/suggestions/weightSuggestions.ts]`

  ```
  Science-based rules (NOT AI):
  - If last RIR = 0-1 AND nutrition = bulk → "+2.5kg"
  - If last RIR = 0-1 AND nutrition = cut → "Maintain weight"
  - If last RIR = 4-5 → "+1 rep or +2.5kg"
  - If plateau + bulk → "Consider deload or variation"
  - If fatigue ratio >1.4 → "Maintain or reduce volume"
  - If performance declining 2+ weeks → "Check recovery"

  Show as subtle suggestions, consider all context
  ```
