## üó∫Ô∏è Revised Roadmap Overview

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 0: Setup ‚úÖ (Weeks 1-2) - COMPLETED
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 0.5: Architecture Setup üöß (Week 3) - IN PROGRESS ‚≠ê CRITICAL
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 1: Auth & Foundation (Weeks 4-5) - NEXT
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 2: Workout Logging (Weeks 6-8)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 3: Exercise Library (Weeks 9-10)

  - Chronic Load: Average volume (last 28 days)
  - Fatigue Ratio: Acute / Chronic
    - >1.5 = HIGH FATIGUE ‚Üí suggest deload
    - 0.8-1.5 = OPTIMAL
    - <0.8 = DETRAINING ‚Üí increase volume
  - Overtraining alerts based on sustained high ratios

  Display in dashboard and post-workout reports
  ```

- [ ] 13.3 Implement personalized 1RM with RIR adjustment (M - 3h) `[src/lib/analytics/personalized1RM.ts]` `[NEW]`
  ```
  Enhancement over basic formulas:
  - Calculate base 1RM (avg of Epley, Brzycki, Lombardi)
  - Adjust by RIR: each RIR point = ~3.3% additional capacity
  - Example: 100kg √ó 8 @ RIR2 = higher e1RM than 105kg √ó 6 @ RIR0
  - Only use "working sets" (exclude warmups, RIR ‚â§ 3)
  - Track personal accuracy factor over time

  Compare PRs using adjusted 1RM, not just raw weight
  ```

- [ ] 13.4 Implement volume distribution analysis (M - 3h) `[src/lib/analytics/volumeDistribution.ts]`
  ```
  Analysis:
  - Volume per muscle group (pie chart)
  - Volume per movement pattern (push/pull/legs)
  - Volume per exercise category (compound vs isolation)
  - Volume per day of week (bar chart)
  - Recommendations: "Increase chest volume by 15% to match back"
  - Contextualize by nutrition phase
  ```

- [ ] 13.5 Add workout frequency & consistency analysis (M - 3h)
  ```
  Metrics:
  - Workouts per week (average, trend, by nutrition phase)
  - Most common workout days
  - Consistency score (%) - missed vs planned
  - Streak tracking (current, longest)
  - Calendar heatmap visualization
  - Session completion rate (started vs finished)
  ```

### 14. Performance Feedback & Reports

- [ ] 14.1 **Create post-workout report system** (L - 6h) `[src/components/analytics/WorkoutReport.tsx]` `[NEW - CRITICAL]`
  ```
  Displayed immediately after "End Workout":
  - Performance Score (1-10) based on:
    - Volume vs historical average (adjusted by nutrition phase)
    - Intensity (avg RIR, set completion)
    - Consistency (adherence to plan/template)
  - Fatigue Estimate: Acute/Chronic Load ratio
    - "Low" / "Moderate" / "High"
  - Contextualized Feedback:
    - "Volume down 8% in cut - expected and healthy"
    - "Maintained intensity despite fatigue - excellent"
  - Recommendations:
    - "Consider extra rest day this week" (high fatigue)
    - "Good recovery indicators, push hard next session"

  Keep it concise (3-4 lines max), actionable, science-based
  ```

- [ ] 14.2 **Create weekly summary system** (L - 5h) `[src/components/analytics/WeeklySummary.tsx]` `[NEW]`
  ```
  Generated every Monday morning (background task):
  - Volume trends (by muscle group, vs previous week)
  - Personal records achieved
  - Consistency metrics (workouts completed, streak)
  - Load management status (acute/chronic ratio)
  - Deload recommendation if needed (sustained high fatigue)
  - Nutrition phase context ("Week 3 of cut, strength maintained")

  Push notification: "Your Weekly Summary is ready!"
  ```

- [ ] 14.3 Add context-aware weight suggestions (M - 4h) `[src/lib/suggestions/weightSuggestions.ts]`
  ```
  Science-based rules (NOT AI):
  - If last RIR = 0-1 AND nutrition = bulk ‚Üí "+2.5kg"
  - If last RIR = 0-1 AND nutrition = cut ‚Üí "Maintain weight"
  - If last RIR = 4-5 ‚Üí "+1 rep or +2.5kg"
  - If plateau + bulk ‚Üí "Consider deload or variation"
  - If fatigue ratio >1.4 ‚Üí "Maintain or reduce volume"
  - If performance declining 2+ weeks ‚Üí "Check recovery"

  Show as subtle suggestions, consider all context
  ```

## üìù Task Management Guidelines

### Task Size Estimates
- **S** (Small): 1-2 hours
- **M** (Medium): 3-6 hours
- **L** (Large): 1-2 days

### Priority Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Blocking other tasks, must be done first
- **HIGH**: Core MVP features
- **MEDIUM**: Important but can be deferred
- **LOW**: Nice-to-have, post-MVP

### File Path Conventions
File paths in brackets `[path/to/file.tsx]` indicate where to create or modify code.

### Dependencies
Tasks are ordered chronologically within phases. Some tasks have dependencies:
- Phase 0.5 must be completed before Phase 1
- Database schema (0.5.2) must be done before any data-related features
- WatermelonDB setup (0.5.1) must be done before using database
